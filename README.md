## Wake Turbulence Questions

This app generates questions randomly for departure-departure wake turbulence. It can account for full length, intersection, crossing runway, and opposite direction runway departures, and has user configurable options to set the rate at which these situations occur.

Bug reporting feature automattically submits question data for review, with optional user input.

It currently has one set of aircraft, the list of aircraft used at MMAC for the terminal course.

### Future Additions

- add user defined aircraft sets
