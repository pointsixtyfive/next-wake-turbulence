## Wake Turbulence Questions

This app generates questions randomly for departure-departure wake turbulence. It can account for full length, intersection, crossing runway, and opposite direction runway departures, and has user configurable options to set the rate at which these situations occur.

It currently has one set of aircraft, the list of aircraft used at MMAC for the terminal course.

### Future Additions

- add report button if there's an issue with the question
- add user defined aircraft sets
